### Quick Documentation Edits

#### Prerequisites

To edit our documentation, you must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com). If you already have one, make sure you are logged in. If you don't, please [create one](https://github.com/join).

#### Understanding GitBook's Integration with GitHub

We use a platform called [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) to host, manage and serve our documentation. GitBook fetches files from our GitHub repository `Lightning-Bounties/docs`, reads them and converts them into the pages you can access on [docs.lightningbounties.com](https://docs.lightningbounties.com).

### Method 1: Quick Editing via GitHub Web Interface

#### **Step 1: Access the Edit Function**

1. Open the page you want to edit on [docs.lightningbounties.com](https://docs.lightningbounties.com)
2. Look for an "Edit on GitHub" button above the Table of Contents on the right side
3. Click on the GitHub icon to navigate to the Markdown file

#### **Step 2: Edit the File**

1. Click on the pencil icon labeled "Edit this file"
2. Make your edits using [Markdown formatting](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/markdown)
3. Use GitBook's [Markdown reference guide](https://gitbook.com/docs/creating-content/formatting/markdown) for proper formatting

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (72).png" alt="Screenshot: GitHub edit interface showing pencil icon on Lightning Bounties docs file"><figcaption><p>GitHub edit interface showing pencil icon on Lightning Bounties docs repo  </p></figcaption></figure>

#### **Step 3: Create Your Pull Request**

1. Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section
2. Write a short, descriptive title for your changes
3. Add a detailed description explaining your improvements
4. **Important**: Include `close #[issue-number]` in your description if you're fixing a specific issue
5. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
6. Click "Propose file change"

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (74).png" alt="Screenshot of the Commit changes box. There are boxes for a brief description of the changes, an extended one, a selection menu for email addresses to associate with the commit, options to commit directly to the current branch or to create a new branch and a pull request (which opens an option to name your branch as you like) and buttons to either Propose file change or Cancel."><figcaption><p>Screenshot of the Commit changes box.

#### Lightning Bounties Payment System

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### The Critical **`close #[issue-number]` Syntax**

To earn Bitcoin bounties for your contributions, you **must** include the `close #[issue-number]` syntax in your pull request description.&#x20;

This connects your PR to the Lightning Bounties issue and triggers automatic payment processing.
{% endhint %}

**Important Notes:**

* The `close` keyword must be in the PR description itself, not in regular comments
* Adding this connection after merging will automatically trigger Lightning Bounty payment
* If you forget to add this initially, you can edit your merged PR description later

### **If You Forgot the Close Syntax**

**Option 1: Edit Your Merged Pull Request**

1. Go to your merged PR and click into it
2. Click the "..." button at the top-right of your PR description
3. Select "Edit"
4. Add `close #[issue-number]` to your PR description
5. Click "Update Comment"

**Option 2: Ask for Help**

If you cannot edit the PR, ask the repository owner to add the `close` syntax for you.

### Repository Structure

Our documentation lives at [Lightning-Bounties/docs](https://github.com/Lightning-Bounties/docs):

```

docs/
├── README.md                    \# Homepage content
├── SUMMARY.md                   \# Navigation structure
├── getting-started/             \# New user guides
│   ├── first-time-onboarding/   \# Account setup
│   ├── posting-a-bounty/        \# For bounty creators
│   └── solving-a-bounty/        \# For bounty hunters
├── glossary-work-in-progress/   \# Platform features
├── resources/                   \# Help \& references

│   ├── troubleshooting/
│   └── socials/
└── .gitbook/
└── assets/                  \# Images and media

```

**Key Components:**

* The `.gitbook/assets` folder manages every file used in any page
* The `SUMMARY.md` file tells GitBook the order and grouping of pages
* The `README.md` file contains the first page content users see
* Groups of pages are controlled by folders named after the group title
* Nested pages have a similar structure, but require a `README.md` file in the parent folder
