# Verify with Branta







***



## Verify with Branta <a href="#verify-with-branta" id="verify-with-branta"></a>

_Authoritative address verification for every Lightning payment on Lightning Bounties._

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

`Verify with Branta` is an **optional yet highly-recommended safety check** that lets you confirm a BOLT-11 invoice before you pay it on Lightning Bounties. Powered by Branta’s **Guardrail** service, the link under each deposit form opens a separate, read-only page that validates the invoice hash and destination against Branta’s independent database.

\
If the data match, the page displays a green “Verified” banner; if anything is off, you will see a red warning so you can abort the payment.

> **Why it matters**: Lightning payments are final. Clipboard-swapping malware, malicious browser extensions or compromised Wi-Fi can silently replace an invoice. `Verify with Branta` gives you a second source of truth so you can transact with confidence.

### Key Benefits <a href="#key-benefits" id="key-benefits"></a>

## Verify with Branta <a href="#verify-with-branta" id="verify-with-branta"></a>

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

**Verify with Branta** is an **optional yet highly-recommended safety check** that lets you confirm a BOLT-11 invoice before you pay it on Lightning Bounties. Powered by Branta's **Guardrail** service, this verification link appears under each payment form and opens a separate, read-only page that validates the invoice hash and destination against Branta's independent database.

{Screenshot showing Lightning Bounties deposit modal displaying QR code, invoice string and the Verify Invoice - Branta link}

### Why Invoice Verification Matters <a href="#why-invoice-verification-matters" id="why-invoice-verification-matters"></a>

**Lightning payments are final**. Once you send Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, there's no way to reverse the transaction. This permanence makes verification crucial because various attack vectors can compromise your payment:

* **Clipboard-swapping malware** can silently replace invoices with attacker addresses120
* **Malicious browser extensions** may intercept and modify payment data
* **Compromised Wi-Fi networks** could perform man-in-the-middle attacks120
* **Phishing websites** might display fraudulent payment requests

**Verify with Branta gives you a second source of truth** so you can transact with confidence12022.

### Best-Practice Scenarios <a href="#best-practice-scenarios" id="best-practice-scenarios"></a>

| Scenario                                  | Recommended Action                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High-value reward deposits**            | Always run Branta verification before paying1                        |
| **Using public or shared Wi-Fi**          | Verify on a second device (phone or offline laptop)1                 |
| **First-time user of Lightning Bounties** | Click the link to experience the safety flow1                        |
| **Suspicious browser behaviour**          | Pause, copy the invoice, open Branta in a different browser profile1 |
| **Anonymous contributions**               | Especially important due to lack of account recovery options         |
| **Corporate contributions**               | Verify large amounts to protect company funds                        |

### Advanced Multi-Device Verification <a href="#advanced-multi-device-verification" id="advanced-multi-device-verification"></a>

For **maximum security on high-value contributions**:

### Two-Device Setup

1. **Generate invoice** on your primary device (computer/phone)
2. **Copy the BOLT-11 invoice string** to clipboard
3. **Open Branta verification** on a second device
4. **Paste and verify** the invoice independently
5. **Cross-check results** between both devices

### Offline Verification

1. **Copy invoice** on connected device
2. **Transfer to offline/airplane mode device** via QR code or manual typing
3. **Use offline device** to access Branta verification
4. **Compare results** before making payment online

This approach **bypasses malware and network level attacks** by using independent infrastructure2027.

{Image showing multi-device verification setup with phone and computer displaying matching verification results}

### Understanding Verification Results <a href="#understanding-verification-results" id="understanding-verification-results"></a>

### Green Verification Status

**Positive verification means**120:

* **Invoice destination confirmed** as legitimate Lightning Bounties address
* **Amount and memo validated** against Branta's database
* **No tampering detected** in the payment request
* **Safe to proceed** with payment

### Red Warning Status

**If Branta shows a red warning**1:

* **Do NOT pay the invoice** under any circumstances
* **Generate a new invoice** on Lightning Bounties
* **Contact Lightning Bounties support** if problems persist
* **Report suspicious activity** to help protect other users

### Verification Process Details

**Branta Guardrail checks**2027:

* **Invoice hash validation** against known legitimate addresses
* **Destination address verification** through cryptographic matching
* **Amount and memo validation** for consistency
* **Timestamp verification** to prevent replay attacks

### Technical Architecture <a href="#technical-architecture" id="technical-architecture"></a>

### Independent Infrastructure

**Branta operates separately** from Lightning Bounties120:

* **Different servers** and network infrastructure
* **Independent database** of verified addresses
* **Separate security protocols** and monitoring
* **Redundant verification** pathways

### Cryptographic Validation

**Guardrail service provides**20:

* **Hash-based verification** of invoice authenticity

* **Tamper detection** through digital signature validation
* **Real-time verification** with minimal latency

### Integration with Anonymous Contributions <a href="#integration-with-anonymous-contributions" id="integration-with-anonymous-contributions"></a>

**Branta verification is especially critical** for anonymous contributions because:

* **No account recovery options** if payments go to wrong addresses
* **Limited dispute resolution** without platform account
* **Higher risk exposure** due to lack of contribution tracking
* **No direct support channel** for payment issues

The **combination of anonymous access and Branta verification** provides the perfect balance of privacy and security22.

### Business Benefits for Lightning Bounties <a href="#business-benefits-for-lightning-bounties" id="business-benefits-for-lightning-bounties"></a>
